Titanic Survival Prediction Project

This repository is dedicated to the exploration and predictive analysis of the Titanic dataset, with a particular focus on utilizing Logistic Regression to classify passengers as survived or deceased. Through the application of data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning, this project aims to provide insights into the factors that influenced survival rates and to build a predictive model with Python.

Project Overview:

data_analysis.ipynb: A comprehensive Jupyter notebook that details the entire process of our analysis. It begins with data cleaning to prepare the dataset for analysis, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover underlying patterns and relationships. The notebook proceeds to feature engineering to enhance the dataset for machine learning, culminating in the implementation of Logistic Regression for classification. This model aims to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic would have survived or perished, based on their characteristics such as age, class, fare, and more.

titanic_dataset.csv: The primary dataset for this project, containing detailed passenger information from the Titanic. It includes crucial variables that are analyzed and used in building the predictive model.

Objective:
The main objective of this project is to predict the survival outcomes of passengers on the Titanic using Logistic Regression. This machine learning technique is particularly well-suited for binary classification tasks like ours, where the goal is to classify individuals into one of two categories: survived or deceased. Through this analysis, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of the factors that significantly impacted survival chances during the tragic sinking of the Titanic.

Technologies Used:
- Python: The core programming language used for all aspects of the project, including data manipulation, analysis, and model building.

- Pandas: A powerful library for data analysis and manipulation. It is used extensively for reading, cleaning, and transforming the dataset into a format suitable for analysis.

- NumPy: An essential library for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for efficient operations on large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, which are crucial for data analysis tasks.

- Matplotlib: A plotting library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python. It is used in this project to generate various charts and graphs to visualize the data and analysis results.

- Seaborn: A statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. It is used alongside Matplotlib to enhance the visual appeal of the plots.

- Scikit-learn: An open-source machine learning library for Python. It is used in this project for implementing Logistic Regression, a key part of the project's predictive modeling. Scikit-learn provides a wide range of tools for model selection, evaluation, and preprocessing.

- Jupyter Notebook: An open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. The project's analysis and findings are presented in a Jupyter Notebook, enabling interactive exploration and documentation.
